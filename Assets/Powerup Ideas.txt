Powerup Ideas
	OFFENCE:
		- Chain Shot: On Hit, bullets arc to a nearby enemy for reduced damage
		- Reactor Core: Slightly increases fire rate and damage the longer you hold fire(ramps over 2s)
	SUPPORT:
		- Deflective Core: 10% chance to reflect enemy bullets back toward them.

Change the Drone to not drop powerups when they run into you
Create Icon for Powerup
	- Piercing Bullets
	- Power Sync Core
	- Vampiric Rounds
	- Critical Surge
Create prefabs for all new powerups
X - Add Multiplier on waves so every 5 waves the multiplier increases increasing their health and damage.
Upgrades - Figure out a simple upgrade system
	- Maybe have the enemies drop currency on killed and use that currency for the upgrades
Remake boss - Possibly into a bullet hell boss
